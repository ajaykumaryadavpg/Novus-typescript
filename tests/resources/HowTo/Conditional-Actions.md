## Say you want to perform some actions if and only if a locator is present

* The user will perform
* actions1 actions2 and actions3
* only when the locator is present/visible on UI
* else it will ignore

```typescript
await actor.attemptsTo(
  Perform.actions(actions1, actions2, actions3)
    .iff(locator)
    .isPresent()
    .log("conditionalAction", "perform actions if locator present")
);
```

## Say you want to perform an action only if the locator is visible

* The user will
* click on locator
* if the locator is visible on the UI
* else it will ignore the Click action on the locator

```typescript
await actor.attemptsTo(Click.on(locator).ifDisplayed());
await actor.attemptsTo(Enter.text("abc").on(locator).ifDisplayed());
```
